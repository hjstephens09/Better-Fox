## BEFORE YOU BEGIN
I have attempted the following troubleshooting suggestions:
- [ ] [Cleared website data](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/clear-browser-cache-firefox.png), restarted Firefox, and my issue persists.
- [ ] No issues when using the website or extension in another web browser.
- [ ] The issue persists when using Firefox in [Safe Mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode#w_how-to-start-firefox-in-safe-mode).
- [ ] Disabled DNS-level content blocking (AdGuard, NextDNS, PiHole), [cleared my DNS cache](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-flush-your-dns-cache), and used my ISP's DNS resolver (if applicable).
