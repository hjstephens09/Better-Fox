# Betterfox
about:config tweaks to enhance [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ "Firefox Homepage"). Files are updated as needed for your [user.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file).


## Made for everyday browsing
**A secure, blazing fast browsing experience. Without breakage.** The objective is to make the defaults sufficient enough for the average privacy-minded user, but remain trouble-free enough that my grandmother could use it. <strike>(That puts a whole new twist on being a foxy grandma!)</strike> Edit: Sorry for the dad joke ðŸ˜“


## Simple goals
1) **Minimalism:** get what isn't needed out of the way
2) **Efficiency:** unleash Firefox's ability to be fast and performant
3) **Security:** sensible privacy and security without causing site breakage


## Simple configs

| List      | Description |
|:---------:|-------------|
| [Fastfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Fastfox.js)   | Immensely increase Firefox's browsing speed. Give Chrome a run for its money!|
| [Securefox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Securefox.js) | Telemetry blocked. [HTTPS-by-Default](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/08/10/firefox-91-introduces-https-by-default-in-private-browsing/). [Total Cookie Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/) with [site isolation](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/05/18/introducing-site-isolation-in-firefox/). Enhanced [state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning) and [network](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/) partitioning. Various other enhancements. |
| [Peskyfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Peskyfox.js)  | Unclutter the new tab page. Remove [Pocket](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-pocket). Restore [compact mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compact-mode-workaround-firefox) as an option. Stop webpage notifications, pop-ups, and other annoyances. |
| [Smoothfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Smoothfox.js) | Get Edge-like smooth scrolling on your favorite browser â€” or choose something more your style. |
| [user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/user.js) | All the essentials. None of the breakage. This is your `user.js`. |

:bulb: `Fastfox`, `Securefox`, `Peskyfox`, and `Smoothfox` are guides to relevant prefs in Firefox. The `user.js` is curated from the options located in these documents. Please read the guides to understand the various options hidden in Firefox.

## about:Privacy
Most repos have niche privacy and security concerns with little regard for speed, annoyances, or mainstream use. Betterfox was inspired by the [law of diminishing returns](https://pmctraining.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Law-of-Diminishing-Returns-CHART.png) and the [minimum effective dose](https://medium.com/the-mission/less-is-more-the-minimum-effective-dose-e6d56625931e). For instance, features like WebGL and DRM are still enabled, and you won't find a setting like `privacy.resistFingerprinting` mentioned here<sup>^[*why?*](https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/wuqpgi/are_there_any_aboutconfig_tweaks_to_get_smooth/ile3whx/?context=3)</sup>. And while Betterfox is designed to set-and-forget, it contains plenty of options for those who like to tinker.

If your context calls for _anonymity_ and not just reasonable _privacy_, then please use [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org).<sup>[1](https://youtu.be/5NrbdO4yWek?t=4334)</sup> [Fingerprinting](https://smartframe.io/blog/browser-fingerprinting-everything-you-need-to-know/) is a high [threat model](https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/prologue/threatmodel/) issue that is [only addressed reasonably by Tor](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.3-Overrides-%5BTo-RFP-or-Not%5D).

## Assumptions
Apply preferences from the [common overrides](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/issues/87) sticky if you want to revert the following behavior:
* Firefox **Accessibility Service** is disabled to improve resource utilization and security. Override this if you use assistive software.
* **Embedded tweets, instagram, reddit posts, and tiktoks** load on webpages, even though these requests are usually blocked when using [Strict Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_strict-enhanced-tracking-protection).
* The native **password manager** is disabled. We recommend using [KeePass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/), [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/), or [1Password](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager).
* **Firefox Sync** and **Firefox View** are disabled.
* **Location requests** are rejected and **site notifications** are disabled.

### Suggestions
* Enable **sanitize on close** ([clear browsing data on shutdown](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/99f2e860633f307781ddb73d792358ad1bec6af5/Securefox.js#L409-L434)).
   * You can **allow exceptions** if you want to stay logged in to some sites:
      1) Go to *Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Cookies and Site Data â†’ Manage Exceptions*
      2) Check *Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed*.
* Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) or [Ghostery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/) to block ads and trackers.
* Add DNS-level protection like [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=xujj63g5). Check out our configuration guide [here](https://github.com/yokoffing/NextDNS-Config).
