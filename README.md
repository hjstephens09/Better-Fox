# Betterfox
about:config tweaks to enhance [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ "Firefox Homepage"). Files are updated as needed for your [user.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file).


## Who is this setup for?
**If you want a secure, blazing fast browsing experience, and don't want to deal with breakage, this setup is for you.** The objective is to make the defaults sufficient enough for the average privacy-minded user, but remain trouble-free enough that my grandmother could use it. <strike>(That puts a whole new twist on being a foxy grandma!)</strike> Edit: Sorry for the dad joke ðŸ˜“


## Simple goals
1) **Minimalism:** get what isn't needed out of the way
2) **Efficiency:** unleash Firefox's ability to be fast and performant
3) **Security:** sensible privacy and security without causing site breakage


## Simple configs

| List      | Description |
|:---------:|-------------|
| [Fastfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Fastfox.js)   | Immensely increase Firefox's browsing speed. Give Chrome a run for its money!|
| [Securefox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Securefox.js) | Remove Telemetry, Mozilla experiments, Google Safe Browsing, and search engine suggestions in URL bar. Auto-upgrade mixed content to HTTPS. Various privacy enhancements. |
| [Peskyfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Peskyfox.js)  | Unclutter the new tab page. Remove Pocket and form autofill. Prevent Firefox from serving annoying webpage notifications. |
| [Smoothfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/Smoothfox.js) | Get Microsoft Edge-like smooth scrolling on your favorite browser. |
| [user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/user.js) | All the essentails. None of the breakage. Users may download this list as their own user.js. |

:bulb: `Fastfox`, `Securefox`, `Peskyfox`, and `Smoothfox` are guides to relevant prefs in Firefox. The `user.js` is curated from the prefs located in these documents, so just because a pref is in one of the guides doesn't mean it is included in the final document, the `user.js`. Please use the descriptions and references as a guide for the prefs in Firefox, and open a [feature request](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/issues/new/choose) if you think one can be improved upon.

## about:Privacy
The guiding principle is: "If it breaks it, it doesn't make it!" So things like WebGL and DRM are still enabled, and you won't find a setting like `privacy.resistFingerprinting` mentioned here ([why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/wuqpgi/are_there_any_aboutconfig_tweaks_to_get_smooth/ile3whx/?context=3)). Betterfox is designed to set-and-forget, not to troubleshoot and tinker. You can compare different user.js files [here](https://jm42.github.io/compare-user.js).

Betterfox was created with a [less is more](https://medium.com/the-mission/less-is-more-the-minimum-effective-dose-e6d56625931e) mentality (i.e., keeping in mind [the law of diminishing returns](https://pmctraining.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Law-of-Diminishing-Returns-CHART.png)). Most repos I've encountered have niche privacy and security concerns with little regard for speed, annoyances, or mainstream use. The average user doesn't need all `prefs` altered to get the results they want.

## Assumptions
If you use any of the features below, please view the [sticky](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/issues/87) to restore functionality.
* **Google Safe Browsing** (GSB) is disabled. We recommend use DNS-level protection like [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=xujj63g5), so check out our configuration guide [here](https://github.com/yokoffing/NextDNS-Config). If you have no other form of protection, then please re-enable GSB.
* The native **password manager** is also disabled. If you don't use something like [KeePass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/), [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/), or [1Password](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager), then re-enable Firefox's password management.
* **Firefox Sync** is disabled.
* **Site notifications** are disabled.
* **Location requests** are rejected.
* **Embedded tweets, instagram, and reddit posts** load on webpages, even though these requests are usually blocked when using Firefox's [Strict Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_strict-enhanced-tracking-protection).
   * Advanced users: We suggest that you [selectively allow](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide) these requests in [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) with [medium mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode) enabled + add the [Privacy Essentials](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists/blob/main/privacy_essentials.txt) filter to your [custom lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists#3rd-party-filter-lists).

Also note that:
* Since Firefox implemented [state](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/537eb902106f5cacebfd7a77555193ba4573dc6e/SecureFox.js#L73-L88) and [network](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/537eb902106f5cacebfd7a77555193ba4573dc6e/SecureFox.js#L93-L100) partitioning, it is recommended but no longer necessary to **clear browsing data** after every session.
* If your threat level calls for _anonymity_ and not just reasonable _privacy_,<sup>[1](https://thenewoil.org/secprivanon.html)</sup> please use the [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org). :thumbsup:

## Credit
* Many thanks to the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) team and to the people working on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home), fighting for the [open web](https://docs.openwebsandbox.org/learn/ows-articles/what-is-the-open-web).
* This repository benefits from the research provided by [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js). While Betterfox does not use their `user.js`, we attempt to maintain parity with it.
